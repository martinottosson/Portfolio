# Portfolio

Hello!

Please feel free to check out my portfolio!

The hands-on labs are part of the Data Science Capstone Project. I have also added the final report for the Capstone Project, the diploma for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the final project from the course Machine Learning with Python..

In the portfolio you can also find a copy of the first page of my Master Degree Certificate (I can send the full version if requested) and you can find my Master Thesis from Uppsala University. It is written in Swedish. There are also official transcript of records for courses taken after graduation.

The file StatisticsSweden contain links to public reports written by me and colleagues to the Consumer Price Index Board in Sweden.

Best Regards
Martin Ottosson
