# Portfolio

Hello!

Please feel free to check out my portfolio!

The hands-on labs (number 0-7) are part of the Data Science Capstone Project. I have also added the final report for the Capstone Project, the diploma for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the final project from the course Machine Learning with Python.

I made a dashboard with Power BI (number 8) presenting findings from an online survey taken by data professionals in 2022 (data source: Alex the Analyst Youtube channel). Download the file or take a look at the screenshot. 

In the portfolio you can also find a copy of the first page of my Master Degree Certificate (I can send the full version if requested) and you can find my Master Thesis from Uppsala University. It is written in Swedish. There are also official transcript of records for courses taken after graduation.

The file StatisticsSweden contain links to public reports written by me and colleagues to the Consumer Price Index Board in Sweden.

Best Regards
Martin Ottosson
