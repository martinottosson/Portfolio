# Portfolio

Hello!

Please feel free to check out my portfolio!

The hands-on labs are part of the Data Science Capstone Project. I have also added the final report and the diploma for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The file StatisticsSweden contain links to public reports written by me and colleagues to the Consumer Price Index Board in Sweden.

I have also added a copy of the first page of my Master Degree Certificate (I can send the full version if requested) and you can find my Master Thesis from Uppsala University. It is written in Swedish.

Best Regards
Martin Ottosson
