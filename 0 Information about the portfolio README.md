# Portfolio

Hello!

Please feel free to check out my portfolio!

0-7 Data Science/Machine Learning with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

The hands-on labs (number 1-7) are part of the Data Science Capstone Project (Python code in Jupyter Notebooks). 
I have also added the final report for the Capstone Project (number 1), the diploma for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the final project from the course Machine Learning with Python (number 0).

8 Power BI

I made a dashboard with Power BI (number 8) presenting findings from an online survey taken by data professionals in 2022 (data source: Alex the Analyst Youtube channel). Download the file or take a look at the screenshot. 

9-11 Statistical Analysis and Visualization with R

Number 9-10 are statistical analyses made in RStudio with two files per project; the R code and a report. 
Number 9 covers Spearman's rank correlation, simple linear regression analysis, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and a paired t-test for testing differences between groups.
Number 10 is a project with a one-way ANOVA for testing differences between means and a two-way ANOVA test with interactions.
Number 11 are two non-parametric Chi-square tests for associations.

12-13 Econometrics with SAS

Number 12 is a report with simple and multiple linear regression models made in SAS.
Number 13 are analyses of time series data using an exponential smoothing method and an ARIMA model made in SAS.

14 Java

This is a Java program with a bidding system for real estate. At the start, the program prints a menu with options that can be selected by the user. 

15-16 Statistical Analysis and Visualization with R

Number 15 is the final project for the first course Statistical Analysis and Visualization in R: I. The methods used in the project are:
Spearman’s rank correlation, a test of difference between groups with the Wilcoxon signed rank test, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, testing differences of more than two groups was made with the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, transformations (arcsine, log10 and square root transformation) and a chi-squared test and a Fisher’s exact test.

Number 16 is a paper with generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson regression models and Logistic regression models.

In the portfolio you can also find a copy of the first page of my Master Degree Certificate (I can send the full version if requested) and you can find my Master Thesis from Uppsala University. It is written in Swedish. There are also official transcript of records for courses taken after graduation.

The file StatisticsSweden contain links to public reports written by me and colleagues to the Consumer Price Index Board in Sweden.
